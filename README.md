# Marketing-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on segmenting customers using psychographic data, such as lifestyle choices, interests, and values, to develop targeted marketing strategies. By leveraging clustering techniques, distinct customer segments were identified, allowing for a deeper understanding of consumer behavior. The segmentation enabled the creation of personalized marketing campaigns that cater to the unique preferences of each group, enhancing engagement through optimized marketing channels such as social media, email campaigns, and influencer partnerships. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of psychographic segmentation in driving customer-centric marketing approaches, leading to higher response rates and improved marketing performance.
